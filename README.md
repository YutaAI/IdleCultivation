THE GUIDE
-----------
Happy Reading to knowing how to play!

OtherOSs
-----------
Make sure to run "Idle Cultivation X.X.X.love", not the "love.exe" 
For first time players, when you run the .love game, if it asks you for what app to run on, make sure to run it on the "love.exe" which is there in the same folder.

Windows
-----------
Run "Idle Cultivation X.X.X.exe" 
That's all

Recurring Players
------------------
For recurring players, if the game gets updated for a different version, only take the .love file (no need for other files) and replace the old version of it. 

I may tell you if it's needed to add other files and such here. 

As of now, there's no need to bring other files except the .love or .exe game. (Not the love.exe)

Use the paths according to your OS System to find your save file.

(For Linux below, inserts shrug here. I am not familar with Linux. If it works for you, then great.)
Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/love/
- Alternative: ~/.local/share/love/
