THE GUIDE
-----------
Make sure to run "Idle Cultivation X.X.X.love", not the "love.exe" 
For first time players, when you run the .love game, if it asks you for what app to run on, make sure to run it on the "love.exe" which is there in the same folder. 
For recurring players, if the game gets updated for a different version, only take the .love file (no need for other files) and replace the old version of it. 

I may tell you if it's needed to add other files and such here. 

As of now, there's no need to bring other files except just the .love game! :D
